# Introduction {-}

In this project, we explore several different algorithms (flavors) to solve Maximum 0-1 Knapsack, a classic NP-Hard problem, _in a reasonable amount of time_. In our experiments, we want to show the difference between running time and the optimal value obtained using these various algorithms. 

We also want to take a side-track and demonstrate how Maximum 0-1 Knapsack can be used to solve 3SAT, the iconic NP-Complete problem, via the polynomial time reduction from 3SAT to Decision 0-1 Knapsack [@oconnell2013].

We are going to explore 4 different flavors of Knapsack solver, including:

* Maximum Value Dynamic Programming
* Minimum Cost Dynamic Programming
* Greedy 2-Approximation 
* Fully Polynomial-time Approximation Scheme
